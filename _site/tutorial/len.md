  <h3>Are Lenses Really That Important?</h3>
  <p>As long as you get along with your lenses, you’ll find that you update your camera body rather than your glass. The cameras change in resolution, features and a great many other ways.The lenses you own today could well be the ones you own for the longest period of time. If you look after them, they will last a lifetime.A camera has shutter actuations, meaning a shelf life. But once you find that great lens, you’ll want to hold on to it.</p>

  <h3>What Does a Camera Lens Do?</h3>
    <p>A lens is a device that contains lens elements. These elements are shaped glass pieces that bend light in specific ways. Each element within the lens has a different function, and they work together in harmony.They do this by helping light beams focus. It sounds simple, but designing and building these lenses is very complicated. Science and mathematics all the way.One of the biggest challenges with a lens is the need for sharpness across the entire width of your scene. This includes the corners.And then you also have zoom lenses. These have to focus light rays to converge and focus at an array of different focal lengths. We won’t go into that here. Just know this – lens designers and creators are amazingly smart.</p>

    <h3>Lens Apertures</h3>
    <p>Aperture is another reason why photographers choose one lens over others. The word aperture means opening, and describes the size of the hole in a lens.This is where the light passes through, making its way to the camera sensor.Apertures might seem a little strange. They are a fraction of the focal length of a lens. We see f-stops written as f/2 or f/11.The ‘f’ in f-stop comes from focal length. The preceding slash is a mathematical expression of the pupil’s diameter.If a lens’s focal length is 10 mm and its entrance pupil diameter is 5 mm, the f-number is 2.The fractions are important here. If you are capturing a scene with a 100 mm focal length lens at f/2, the diameter of your lens is 50 mm across.Likewise, if you’re shooting at f/4, then the diameter is 100/4 = 25 mm.The f-number gets bigger but the aperture gets smaller. This is important, but normal as we are talking about fractions. F/2 is bigger than f/4, which is bigger than f/8.</p>

  <h3>Focusing a Lens</h3>
  <p>All lenses have some sort of way to focus the scene in front of you. If you’re looking for a technical definition, the focus is “the point where light rays originating from a point on the object converge”.An area of your image needs to be in focus. Perhaps you were to capture a tree. To gain a sharp focus, the light rays from that dot need to hit as few pixels as possible on your digital sensor.When it comes to your image, there are areas in focus and areas out-of-focus. If you see sharp edges on an object, the object can be said to be in focus.Focusing happens within the lens. This happens by moving one or more lens elements closer to or farther away from your camera’s imaging sensor.The lens ‘bends’ the light and forces it to converge at different distances from the sensor.The ideal convergence needs to fall exactly on your imaging chip. When you achieve that, you have a perfectly focused image or subject.</p>
