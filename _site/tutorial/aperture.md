<h3>What does ISO mean?</h3>
<p>Perhaps you have heard this term before, but not many know what the ISO abbreviation actually means. The acronym ‘ISO’ stands for International Organization for Standardization, a group that has created tens of thousands of technology and product standards, including those for film sensitivity.Back in the days of traditional film photography, ISO referred to the film’s sensitivity to light. You may have seen rolls of film with a 100, 200, or 400 ISO. The lower the number, the lower the sensitivity of the film.So, if you were shooting outside in bright daylight, you would buy ISO 100 film knowing that it would be exposed to a lot of sun.Alternatively, if you were planning to photograph an indoor event, you would buy ISO 400 film to capture brighter photos in a darker space. When the industry made the switch to digital, the term ISO was adopted to describe the sensitivity of the camera’s sensor, since it replaced film in cameras.</p>

<h3>How does ISO affect your photographs?</h3>
<p>To understand how changing your ISO setting will affect your photographs, it help to look at the exposure triangle.Each of the three elements of the triangle works together to basicaly lighten or darken your image. When you ajust one of them, the other two are also affected. In the case of ISO, you'll always want to stick to the lowest number possible. When a high aperture is needed or when your subject is in motion and you have to decide between a blurry or a bit of noise,you bump your shutter speed.Don't worry if this is a bit confusing, we'll give you some scenarios a little later.</p>

<h3>What is ISO in photograph</h3>
<p>It still is a camera setting, but play with it can give your photographs a different look.There's always a trade-off between a higher ISO value and the nosie level of the photoshoot.Raising your ISO will always add grain to your photos, also referred to as noise in the previous sentence, so the resulting photo might not be as crisp and sharp as you'd like, thus, rendering it unusable. You should only raise your ISO when you are unable to brighten the photo via shutter speed or apertue instead (for example, if using a longer shutter speed would cause your subject to be blurry). That said, there are plenty of times when you'll need to use a high ISO to compensate for low light.</p>
