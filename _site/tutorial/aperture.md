  <h3>What Is Aperture?</h3>
  <p>The easiest definition for aperture is to say that it’s the opening of your lens. This adjustable “hole” in your lens is also called the diaphragm.The best way to understand the aperture definition is to think of it as the pupil of an eye. In low light conditions, the pupil is wider letting in as much light as possible. When there’s too much light, like direct sunlight, it shrinks to compensate for the amount of light. In photography, the lens of your camera works just like this.As the diameter of the aperture size changes, it allows more or less light onto the sensor. This depends on the situation and the scene being photographed.</p>

  <h3>How to Understand the Aperture Values?</h3>
    <p>Aperture can be confusing sometimes. Some people will say a wide or narrow aperture, but others might say a large aperture number or a small one. What is the difference? A wide aperture refers to the wide opening in the lens, where an aperture like f/1.2 or f/1.8 is being discussed.Don’t worry if you don’t understand what these f/numbers are yet. This will be tackled in the next section, just follow along.A larger aperture number refers to the number of f/stop when f/22 or f/32 is being discussed. A large aperture number, a narrow or a small aperture are the same things. One talks about the size of the number and the other relates to the size of the opening in your lens.</p>

    <h3>Which Aperture is Best for Landscape Photography?</h3>
    <p>Smaller apertures like f/8 or f/16 are usually used to create a wider focus area. This is most commonly used in landscape photography.Just think of a scene with a lake in the foreground and mountains in the background. Here you have a great distance between the lake and the mountains, but you want to have as many things to be in focus as possible. To achieve this one, you have to set your aperture to a high f-stop number.</p>

  <h3>How Does Aperture Affect Bokeh?</h3>
  <p>Another creative photography effect of a large aperture is bokeh. Bokeh is basically the out-of-focus blurry background of your image. It’s the most effective when you have a very shallow depth of field and a rich background. You can see it on the below picture how the city lights create this effect in the background, behind the subject.</p>
