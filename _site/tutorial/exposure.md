  <h3>What Is Exposure? </h3>
  <p>Every advanced and professional photographer today absolutely needs to learn how to use exposure in photography. When you first start taking pictures, you might be confused by the countless buttons and menu options on your camera. However, there is no excuse for using a bad in-camera exposure. By understanding how to expose an image properly, you will be able to capture photographs of the ideal brightness, including high levels of detail in both the shadows and highlight areas. This article explains exposure in detail, as well as helping you understand the three most important camera settings of all: shutter speed, aperture, and ISO.</p>

  <h3>What is the exposure triangle</h3>
    <p>The "exposure triangle" refers to the influence that each of the three camera / lens settings have on the other. If you simply want to make your exposure brighter or darker, then you would brighten or darken one or more of the three settings. A slower shutter speed, a higher ISO, or a wider aperture, for example, would all make your exposure brighter.However, understanding the exposure triangle is also often used to keep your exposure the SAME, yet achieve a different creative result. For example if you brighten your shutter speed, but darken your aperture by the same amount, the brightness of your exposure would remain exactly the same, however the tighter aperture would render more of your image in focus.</p>

    <h3>How Do You Use the Exposure Triangle to Achieve Correct Exposure</h3>
    <p>There are several ways to adjust the ISO, shutter speed, and aperture. Each of the methods we’ll be discussing allows you to achieve proper exposure. But each option also affects the way your photo looks. So it’s essential that you know which component you change to get the result you want.</p>

  <h3>How Can You Master Exposure in Photography</h3>
  <p>Technically, the exposure triangle is a mathematical equation. The settings you use have predictable results. If you change your shutter speed one notch, then it only makes sense that the aperture should also move one notch.Just remember that if you increase one exposure setting, you have to decrease the other or vice versa. What do I mean by this? Let’s say your aperture setting is f/2.8, and your shutter speed is 1/100th of a second. If you widen your aperture to f/2, you’ll need to increase your shutter speed to 1/125th.So why increase the exposure setting to 1/125th instead of decreasing it to 1/60th? The main reason is that you’re letting more light in when you changed your aperture from f/2.8 to f/2. To avoid overexposing your photo, you’ll need to increase the shutter speed to make up for that extra light coming in. That way, you can still correctly expose your image even after you make your adjustments.
