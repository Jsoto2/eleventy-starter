  <h3>What does ISO mean?</h3>
  <p>Perhaps you have heard this term before, but not many know what the ISO abbreviation actually means. The
    acronym ‘ISO’ stands for International Organization for Standardization, a group that has created tens of
    thousands of technology and product standards, including those for film sensitivity.Back in the days of
    traditional film photography, ISO referred to the film’s sensitivity to light. You may have seen rolls of film
    with a 100, 200, or 400 ISO. The lower the number, the lower the sensitivity of the film.So, if you were
    shooting outside in bright daylight, you would buy ISO 100 film knowing that it would be exposed to a lot of
    sun.Alternatively, if you were planning to photograph an indoor event, you would buy ISO 400 film to capture
    brighter photos in a darker space. When the industry made the switch to digital, the term ISO was adopted to
    describe the sensitivity of the camera’s sensor, since it replaced film in cameras.</p>

  <h3>How does ISO affect your photographs?</h3>
    <p>To understand how changing your ISO setting will affect your photographs, it help to look at the exposure
      triangle.Each of the three elements of the triangle works together to basicaly lighten or darken your image.
      When you ajust one of them, the other two are also affected. In the case of ISO, you'll always want to stick
      to the lowest number possible. When a high aperture is needed or when your subject is in motion and you have
      to decide between a blurry or a bit of noise,you bump your shutter speed.Don't worry if this is a bit
      confusing, we'll give you some scenarios a little later.</p>

    <h3>What is ISO in photograph</h3>
    <p>It still is a camera setting, but play with it can give your photographs a different look.There's always a
      trade-off between a higher ISO value and the nosie level of the photoshoot.Raising your ISO will always add
      grain to your photos, also referred to as noise in the previous sentence, so the resulting photo might not be
      as crisp and sharp as you'd like, thus, rendering it unusable. You should only raise your ISO when you are
      unable to brighten the photo via shutter speed or apertue instead (for example, if using a longer shutter
      speed would cause your subject to be blurry). That said, there are plenty of times when you'll need to use a
      high ISO to compensate for low light.</p>

  <h3>Common ISO Values</h3>
  <p>What is ISO on a camera? Well, as explained before, it’s an option you can play around with. All cameras are different, but they all will include a common set of ISO values (commonly known as “stops”).You’ll usually see ISO values like 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400, and so on. You may hear the term “base ISO” often. That simply refers to your camera’s lowest native ISO setting. In most modern digital cameras, that setting is ISO 100.This is important, because the base ISO, or lowest ISO, gives you the sharpest photo with the least amount of noise. You should always try to use your camera’s base ISO to get the best quality images. However, that’s not always possible.Some cameras offer extended high and low values for ISO that will allow you to set your ISO above or below your camera’s native range. These are simulated ranges, however, and will reduce your image quality. It’s not recommended that you use them.</p>
