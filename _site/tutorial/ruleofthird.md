  <h3>What is the Rule of Thirds?</h3>
  <p>The rule of thirds describes a basic compositional structure of a photograph. Taking any image, you can split it into 9 segments by using 3 vertical and 3 horizontal lines.When you’re photographing an animal, or a person, you tend to use the rule of thirds to provide an area of the image for the subject to “look into.” For example, as shown in the photo above, I have allowed two-thirds of space for the proboscis monkey to look towards.</p>

  <h3>How to Compose Your Photos</h3>
    <p>When you first pick up a camera, you’ll probably find yourself shooting images left, right, and centre. There is so much to remember and learn in that first crucial period as a beginner, and actually paying attention to composition whilst taking photographs can be a challenge. That is particularly the case for wildlife photographers, as those fleeting moments will encourage you to snap a picture whilst you have a chance, rather than miss the opportunity by worrying about composition.But as you gain experience, you’ll find that you are able to slow the process down and apply things like the rule of thirds without much thought. To shoot a frame that obeys the rule of thirds in photography, you need to ensure that you allow for enough space so that you can later fine-tune the composition with a bit of cropping. Perhaps you get it right first time, but often you’ll find yourself tweaking the crop even if it’s just by a matter of a few pixels</p>

    <h3>Tips for Perfecting the Rule of Thirds</h3>
    <p>There are a couple of ways that come to mind for those wanting to practice with the rule of thirds. Eventually, you should be able to gauge the composition by eye, but initially you may want some assistance. With experience, you’ll find that some crops just “feel” better – I actually feel slightly uncomfortable sometimes when looking at a photo that is composed a little “off,” and use this intuition to improve my composition.Firstly, a number of cameras allow you to enable a gridded overlay in the viewfinder. In fact, I have yet to find a camera that doesn’t offer this – even iPhones do! So dig into your camera’s menu, and try to enable a compositional aid overlay. This should help you to compose on the move.Secondly, when you’re cropping your photos in your editing software, you should be able to enable the same overlay on the cropping tool. This can be done in Photoshop, as well as Lightroom and Luminar.

  <h3>Common ISO Values</h3>
  <p>What is ISO on a camera? Well, as explained before, it’s an option you can play around with. All cameras are different, but they all will include a common set of ISO values (commonly known as “stops”).You’ll usually see ISO values like 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200, 6400, and so on. You may hear the term “base ISO” often. That simply refers to your camera’s lowest native ISO setting. In most modern digital cameras, that setting is ISO 100.This is important, because the base ISO, or lowest ISO, gives you the sharpest photo with the least amount of noise. You should always try to use your camera’s base ISO to get the best quality images. However, that’s not always possible.Some cameras offer extended high and low values for ISO that will allow you to set your ISO above or below your camera’s native range. These are simulated ranges, however, and will reduce your image quality. It’s not recommended that you use them.</p>
