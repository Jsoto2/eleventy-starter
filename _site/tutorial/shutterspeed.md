<h3>What is Sutter Speed?</h3>
<p>Shutter speed is the length of time the camera shutter is open, exposing light onto the camera sensor. Essentially, it’s how long your camera spends taking a photo. This has a few important effects on how your images will appear.

When you use a long shutter speed (also known as a “slow” shutter speed), you end up exposing your sensor for a significant period of time. The first big effect of it is motion blur. If your shutter speed is long, moving subjects in your photo will appear blurred along the direction of motion. This effect is used quite often in advertisements of cars and motorbikes, where a sense of speed and motion is communicated to the viewer by intentionally blurring the moving wheels.</p>

<h3>How Shutter Speed is Measured</h3>
<p>Shutter speeds are typically measured in fractions of a second when they are under a second. For example, 1/4 means a quarter of a second, while 1/250 means one-two-hundred-and-fiftieth of a second (or four milliseconds).

Most modern DSLRs and mirrorless cameras can handle shutter speeds of 1/4000th of a second at the fastest, while some can handle even quicker speeds of 1/8000th of a second and faster. On the other hand, the longest available shutter speed on most DSLRs or mirrorless cameras is typically 30 seconds. You can use a longer shutter speed by using external remote triggers, if necessary.

<h3>What is ISO in photograph</h3>
<p>It still is a camera setting, but play with it can give your photographs a different look.There's always a trade-off between a higher ISO value and the nosie level of the photoshoot.Raising your ISO will always add grain to your photos, also referred to as noise in the previous sentence, so the resulting photo might not be as crisp and sharp as you'd like, thus, rendering it unusable. You should only raise your ISO when you are unable to brighten the photo via shutter speed or apertue instead (for example, if using a longer shutter speed would cause your subject to be blurry). That said, there are plenty of times when you'll need to use a high ISO to compensate for low light.</p>
